**Hit Rate: 100%** | **Avg Latency: 26.58s**

Complete demographic profile requiring multiple data points.

**Performance:** Outstanding. The system synthesized multiple demographic dimensions into a comprehensive profile.

## Query Difficulty Analysis

### Easy Queries (2 queries)
- **Hit Rate:** 100%
- **Avg Latency:** 12.48s
- **Performance:** Perfect handling of basic factual queries

### Medium Queries (8 queries)
- **Hit Rate:** 100%
- **Avg Latency:** 15.32s
