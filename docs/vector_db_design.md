# Vector DB Design for Population Data

## Data Structure Analysis
- **Total Records**: 35,830 records
- **Time Range**: 1970-2025 (55 years)
- **States**: Malaysia, Kedah, Selangor
- **Demographics**: 21 age groups, 3 sexes, 9 ethnicities
- **Records per year**: ~800 (consistent)

## Recommended Vector DB Strategy

### 1. Chunking Strategy: **Year-State-Demographic Groups**

**Why this approach:**
- Natural temporal grouping (users often ask about specific years)
- Manageable chunk sizes (~300-500 tokens per chunk)
- Preserves demographic context for detailed queries
- Enables both high-level and granular queries

### 2. Chunk Structure

Each chunk will contain:
- **Text for embedding**: Descriptive summary of population data
- **Metadata**: Structured fields for filtering

### 3. Metadata Schema

```python
metadata = {
    # Core identifiers
    "chunk_id": "unique_identifier",
    "state": "Malaysia|Kedah|Selangor",
    "year": 2024,
    "date_range": "2024-01-01",
    
    # Demographic filters
    "age_groups": ["overall", "0-4", "5-9", ...],
    "sex_categories": ["both", "male", "female"],
    "ethnicity_categories": ["overall", "bumi_malay", "chinese", ...],
    
    # Data summary
    "total_population": 33942.9,  # Overall population for chunk
    "data_points": 189,  # Number of records in this chunk
    "data_source": "state_parquet|malaysia_api",
    
    # Search optimization
    "text_content": "descriptive_text_for_embedding",
    "ingestion_timestamp": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### 4. Text Content for Embeddings

Each chunk will have descriptive text like:
```
Population data for Selangor in 2024. Total population: 8,542.9 thousand people.
Demographic breakdown: 
- Overall population: 8,542.9k
- Male population: 4,321.5k
- Female population: 4,221.4k
Age distribution: 0-4 years (521.8k), 5-9 years (512.3k), 10-14 years (498.7k)...
Ethnic composition: Bumi Malay (4,234.1k), Chinese (1,234.5k), Indian (456.7k)...
Data source: DOSM state parquet file.
```

### 5. Chunking Logic

```python
def create_population_chunks(df):
    chunks = []
    
    # Group by year and state
    for (year, state), group in df.groupby([df['date'].dt.year, 'state']):
        # Create summary chunk
        chunk_text = create_descriptive_text(group, year, state)
        metadata = create_metadata(group, year, state)
        
        chunks.append({
            "text": chunk_text,
            "metadata": metadata
        })
    
    return chunks
```

### 6. Expected Chunk Count

- **States**: 3 (Malaysia, Kedah, Selangor)
- **Years**: 55 (1970-2025)
- **Total chunks**: ~165 chunks

This creates manageable, context-rich chunks that support both broad and specific queries.

### 7. Query Types Supported

**High-level queries:**
- "What was Malaysia's population in 2023?"
- "Show population trends in Selangor"

**Demographic queries:**
- "How many elderly people live in Kedah?"
- "What's the gender breakdown in Selangor 2024?"

**Comparative queries:**
- "Compare Kedah and Selangor populations"
- "Show ethnic composition changes over time"

### 8. Citation Format

```
[Source: DOSM {data_source}, State: {state}, Year: {year}, Data Points: {count}]
```

Example: `[Source: DOSM state_parquet, State: Selangor, Year: 2024, Data Points: 189]`

### 9. Benefits of This Design

1. **Efficient Retrieval**: Year-state groupings enable fast temporal queries
2. **Rich Context**: Each chunk contains comprehensive demographic breakdown
3. **Scalable**: Easy to add more states or time periods
4. **Flexible**: Supports both aggregate and detailed queries
5. **Traceable**: Clear citations with data source and coverage

This design balances chunk size, context preservation, and query flexibility for population data analysis.
